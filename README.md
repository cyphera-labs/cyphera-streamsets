Format-preserving encryption for [StreamSets](https://streamsets.org/) — StreamSets Processor powered by Cyphera.

Built on [`io.cyphera:cyphera`](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.cyphera/cyphera) from Maven Central.

## Build

```bash
mvn package -DskipTests
```

## Install / Deploy

Copy the fat JAR to your StreamSets Data Collector plugin directory. See the platform documentation for details.

## Usage

Protect sensitive fields in data engineering pipelines using Cyphera format-preserving encryption. Header-driven access means no configuration name is needed to decrypt — the header embedded in the protected value identifies which configuration to use.

## Configuration File

```json
{
  "configurations": {
    "ssn": { "engine": "ff1", "key_ref": "demo-key", "header": "T01" },
    "credit_card": { "engine": "ff1", "key_ref": "demo-key", "header": "T02" }
  },
  "keys": {
    "demo-key": { "material": "2B7E151628AED2A6ABF7158809CF4F3C" }
  }
}
```

## Future
